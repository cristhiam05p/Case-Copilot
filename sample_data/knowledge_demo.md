## SSO / SAML login failures
If users see "Invalid SAML response" after IdP metadata changes, verify:
- The IdP signing certificate matches the configured certificate in Salesforce.
- The Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL in the IdP matches the Salesforce SSO endpoint.
- The NameID format matches the Salesforce SSO configuration.
If metadata was rotated, re-upload the IdP metadata file and test with a single user.

## Billing portal timeouts
Time-outs when loading invoices can be caused by:
- Large invoice PDFs on accounts with 3+ years of history.
- Browser extensions blocking the invoice API calls.
Mitigation: filter to a smaller date range, disable extensions, and collect HAR logs.

## API rate limits
HTTP 429 responses indicate rate limiting. Recommendations:
- Review API usage in Setup > System Overview.
- Consolidate calls and use Bulk API for large exports.
- For higher limits, submit a support request with the integration name and peak usage window.

## Email delivery delays
Password reset emails can be delayed if outbound email services are under load.
Workarounds:
- Ask users to check spam/quarantine.
- Confirm the org's Email Relay configuration.
- Share a one-time reset link generated by an admin.

## Data export missing fields
If custom fields are missing from CSV exports:
- Ensure the fields are included in the export profile.
- Confirm field-level security grants access.
- Rebuild the export template after schema changes.

## Mobile app crash
If the iOS app crashes after login:
- Collect device model and OS version.
- Clear app cache and reinstall.
- Check whether MFA policies changed recently.
